### Title 
test_doubly_linked_list.cpp
***
### Author 
Garrison Shepard

### Created 
March 8th, 2018
***
### Description  
Tests This is an implementation of a doubly linked list data structure
Tests are run against operations to verify correctness.
***
### Purpose 
To provide a doubly linked list implementation for general use 
and study. Of Interest to those preparing for software engineering 
interviews and studying Computer Science. Originally created for a CS community 
on a college campus for interview preparation, now open for public use.
***
### Usage
./test_doubly_linked_list_implementation
***
### Build With 
g++ -g -std=c++11 -Wall -I -c test_doubly_linked_list.cpp -o test_doubly_linked_list.o
g++ -g -std=c++11 -Wall -o ./test_doubly_linked_list_implementation test_doubly_linked_list.o 
                                  -I.-L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lm 
Or Build with 'make all' command (for this convenience a make file has been include).

### Modifications 
no modifications since creation date.

### Testing
test_doubly_linked_list.cpp contains a series of test cases that verfiy the correctness
of the operations of the provided stack implementation. 

Each test produces output signaling the successful completion or failure of a test
for a specific stack operation. In addition to the signaling of a test failure an 
error message is generated and displayed. The error message is generated by the 
ERR_MSG macro 

ERR_MSG macro defined in test_linked_queue.cpp
TEST_FAIL(method_name) macro defined in test_doubly_linked_list.cpp
TEST_SUCCESS(method_name) macro defined in test_doubly_linked_list.cpp
LOG macro defined in test_doubly_linked_list.cpp

ERR_MSG macro provides information on the where abouts of the error in the tester 
program to narrow down the source of the problem in the code.
TEST_FAIL(method_name) denotes failure of test
TEST_SUCCESS(method_name) denotes success of test
LOG denotes when a line is executed
